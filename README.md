# Bootcamp Challenge 1: Refractor code
## Description: 
For this challenge, we were asked to take pre-existing code and bring it up to the client's standards based on their user story which requested alt tags on image elements for greater accessibility, headings that fall in sequential order, semantic HTML elements, and logical flow of HTML elements, and comments before variou sections of the page for code readability.
